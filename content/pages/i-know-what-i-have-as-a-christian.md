# I Know What I Have as a Christian

## 1. I have the God-kind of life

The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. John 10:10

That whoever believes in him may have eternal life. "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. John 3:15-16

Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. John 3:36

I have eternal life. Eternal life is the life of God, and this life was given to me when I received Jesus into my heart.

My spirit is full of ZOE. My soul is full of ZOE. My body is full of ZOE.

This ZOE life is a life-giving spirit. Therefore, no sickness can dwell in my body. All weaknesses and diseases cannot stay in my body.

If I meet a circumstance I do not like, I proclaim by faith to change the situation. When I proclaim in this ZOE life by faith, the situation cannot help but change.

## 2. I have righteousness

And are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, Romans 3:24

Who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification. Romans 4:25

For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. 2 Corinthians 5:21

And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption, 1 Corinthians 1:30

And be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith. Philippians 3:9

I am righteous. Christ has become my righteousness, and therefore, I am righteous.

Righteousness is my nature. I can always stand in the presence of God without any sense of guilt or inferiority regardless of my actions.

My spirit has the ability to always act according to God's will.

I am always righteous. Therefore, my prayers are always answered.

## 3. I have the remission of sins

For this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. Matthew 26:28

For whenever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows everything. 1 John 3:20

How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God. Hebrews 9:14

To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name. Acts 10:43

My sins have been remitted. I am a righteous man and I am no longer a sinner. If I sin, I confess my sins and quickly step out of condemnation.

My sins have been completely remitted.

## 4. I have salvation, deliverance, and freedom

He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, Colossians 1:13

"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor." Luke 4:18-19

To open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me. Acts 26:18

I know who I am. I am a child of God. I am a joint-heir with Christ.

Everything in this world must obey the name of Jesus.

I have overcome Satan. Christ has brought me out from the kingdom of darkness and has freed me into the kingdom of his dear Son.

Now the devil has nothing to do with me. Satan cannot manifest in any area of my life.

I declare Satan's manifestations to be illegal in any area of my life.

"Satan, I command you in the name of Jesus, leave me!"
