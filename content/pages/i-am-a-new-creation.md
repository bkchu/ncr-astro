# I Am a New Creation

Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. 2 Corinthians 5:17

Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever. 1 Peter 1:23

Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. James 1:18

I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. Galatians 2:20

For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. Galatians 3:26-27

He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, Colossians 1:13

For if, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ. Romans 5:17

So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. 2 Corinthians 4:16

I was born again from heaven by receiving Jesus into my heart. He has delivered me from the power of darkness, and has translated me into the kingdom of his dear Son. I was crucified with Christ, but now I am quickened together with Christ and I sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. His authority is my authority.

It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. I have put on Christ. I have become a new creation; not partially changed but completely renewed in the realm of the spirit. I function in the realm of the Spirit and in the realm of the Word as a new creation.

I have the nature of Christ. I have the love of Christ. I have the power of Christ. I can change things through my new nature when I think, speak and act according to the Word.

Now I am never disappointed by things or circumstances in the world, but I walk according to the Word of God to reign in life by Jesus Christ. I am never discouraged. For though my outward man perish, the inward man is renewed day by day, and I change from glory to glory and go from power above power.

I am a new creation born again with his divine life and nature.
