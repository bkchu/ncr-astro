# I Know Who I am in Christ

They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth. As you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world. John 17:16-18

But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to the innumerable angels in festal gathering, and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel. Hebrews 12:22-24

No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. Romans 8:37

But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. 1 Peter 2:9

I know who I am in Christ.

I am a child of God.

I live in the world, but I am not of the world.

I am a citizen of Zion.

Therefore, I live according to the spiritual principles of Zion. John 17:16 Hebrews 12:22

I am from above.

I live a supernatural life by faith.

Nothing can make me a victim.

I am more than a conqueror who has overcome the world, and I reign in this world supernaturally. Romans 8:37

Thank you, Jesus. I know who I am.

I am a new creation in Christ. 2 Corinthians 5:17

I live by the life of God, the same life Jesus had. 1 John 4:17

You have given me all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the cross by your divine power. 2 Peter 1:3

Where my feet tread upon, those promises in your Word are already guaranteed. Joshua 1:3

## 1. I have eternal life

For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16

In him was life, and the life was the light of men. John 1:4

But these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name. John 20:31

And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.  1 John 5:11-12

I have eternal life.

This eternal life is God-kind of life (ZOE), and it has been given to me when I received Jesus.

My spirit is full of ZOE. My soul is full of ZOE. My body is full of ZOE.

ZOE is a life-giving spirit. Therefore, no sickness can stay in my body. Any infirmity or disease cannot stand but leave.

When I am confronted with circumstances I do not like, I declare by faith to change the situation. When I declare in ZOE, situations cannot help but change.

## 2. I have conquered the devil

Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery. Hebrews 2:14-15

By canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him. Colossians 2:14-15

Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. 1 John 4:4

And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death. Revelation 12:11

Being in Christ, I have overcome the devil. I do not fear the devil. The devil has nothing to do with me. Therefore, I always win. This is because greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world.

## 3. I have faith

For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned. Romans 12:3

For we walk by faith, not by sight. 2 Corinthians 5:7

I have faith. It has been given to me when I was born again, and it has the power to move mountains.

I do not walk by sight. I walk by faith. Because I think, speak and act in the realm of faith, I always win. I increase my faith by hearing the Word, and as I act on my faith, my faith gets stronger. I overcome the world by faith.

## 4. I became righteous by the righteousness of God

And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption, 1 Corinthians 1:30

And are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, Romans 3:24

Who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification. Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Romans 4:25 Romans 5:1

For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. 2 Corinthians 5:21

I am righteous. Because Christ became my righteousness, I became righteous. I was born again righteous by the new birth in faith. Righteousness is my nature.

No matter what I do, I can always stand before the presence of God without any condemnation or a sense of inferiority.

My spirit always has the ability to do the will of God. I am always bold. As a righteous man, my prayers always work. Therefore, I always get my prayers answered.

## 5. I have grace which enables me to do all things with excellence

But grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of Christ's gift. Ephesians 4:7

I can do all things through him who strengthens me. Philippians 4:13

And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. Romans 8:28

But the anointing that you received from him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about everything, and is true, and is no lie - just as it has taught you, abide in him. 1 John 2:27

Because an excellent spirit, knowledge, and understanding to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve problems were found in this Daniel, Daniel 5:12

I have grace flowing out of my Spirit, so my life is full of your beauty, favor, charm, and dignity.

Because of this grace, I am favored by my superiors, colleagues, friends, and my subordinates.

This grace is God's ability to overcome any situation against me. God's ability is working in my spirit.

I can do anything through Christ who gives me the ability. God is my ability. I am not using human abilities. I have supernatural ability. I can do all things.

My mind is anointed. My spirit is anointed.

I am excellent. Joseph received a spirit of excellence. Daniel also received an excellent spirit. I have also received an excellent spirit. Nothing is impossible to me. God's ability is working in me.

No weapon formed against me shall prosper, because greater is he that is in me, than he that is in the world. God is my ability.

## 6. I Am A Christian Who Is Legally And Legitimately A Son Of God With His Life

See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Beloved, we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is. 1 John 3:1-2

And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, "Abba! Father!" Galatians 4:6

Jesus said to her, "Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'" John 20:17

Because I am a son of God, I can call him, Abba, Father.

God sent his only begotten son to the world so that we could dwell in him.

I reign in this world as Jesus reigned in this world.

I refuse to be sick.

I refuse to fail.

I am more than a conqueror through him that loved me.

I am blessed.

Blessings follow me wherever I go.

Because Jesus brought eternal life, I live the same class of life as him.

I am an ark of blessing. I live like a king in the world. As a king speaks with authority, I speak like a king. My words come to pass.

Iâ€™m not ordinary.

## 7. Christians Are The Righteousness Of God.

For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. 2 Corinthians 5:21

And the effect of righteousness will be peace, and the result of righteousness, quietness and trust forever. Isaiah 32:17

But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a dedicated nation, \[God's] own purchased, special people, that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light. 1 Peter 2:9

I am the righteousness of God. I am the trophy of his goodness. I am his ambassador. I am his messenger.

People come to know God through me. People see that God is alive and working through me.

Every part of my life represents the glory of God.
